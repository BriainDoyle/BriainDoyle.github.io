        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Bríain (that’s me over to the right)!</p>
        <p>From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by what makes things tick. This curiosity led me to Dublin City
            University, where I am now finishing my Master’s in Mechatronic Engineering. A turning point came during my
            internship with Pfizer, where I invested in my first 3D printer (Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro) and a soldering iron.
            This allowed me to start moving from theory to reality, transforming ideas into prototypes like my LED
            matrix lamp and a custom flight controller built around the Arduino Pro Mini.</p>

        <h3>Professional Foundations</h3>
        <p>Beyond my personal projects, my professional foundation is built on a mix of technical depth and operational
            leadership. During my internship with Pfizer, I collaborated with multiple teams to deliver 3D printed
            engineering solutions and coordinated project schedules with external contractors. Furthermore, my
            experience as a Store Supervisor and Mathematics Tutor has sharpened my ability to lead teams, manage high
            pressure environments and communicate complex technical concepts to any audience.</p>

        <h3>Beyond the Workstation</h3>
        <p>When I’m away from the workstation, you’ll likely find me on a hurling pitch. I’ve been a member of the GAA
            since I was four years old, and it’s always been a massive part of my life. One of my proudest moments was
            captaining my team to a championship final, an experience that taught me a lot about leadership and staying
            calm under pressure. Recently, I’ve also taken the opportunity to travel, exploring cities like Budapest,
            Munich, and Edinburgh. Last summer, I spent four months working and traveling across America, where I picked
            up a camera and started exploring photography. You can see a small collection of my favourite shots below.
